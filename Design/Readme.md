## Topic 01: Predictive Crime Analytics Dashboard ##
**Brief** 
How might we design a better way for law enforcement officers to view and respond to real-time crime data?

**User Need**
Officers need a clear overview of live crime incidents and the ability to quickly assign personnel to cases.

**Note!**
Stay focused on real-time crime tracking and case assignment, not the entire dashboard.

## Topic 02: Citizen Safety & Reporting App ##
**Brief** 
How might we design a seamless way for citizens to report suspicious activities through a mobile app?

**User Need**
Users should be able to report an incident by selecting a crime type, uploading evidence, and choosing to submit anonymously or with their ID.

**Note!**
Stay focused on the reporting experience, not the entire app.

## Topic 03: Safe Route Navigation System ##
**Brief** 
How might we design a mobile feature that helps users find the safest route home using real-time crime data.

**User Need**
The system should compare different routes and highlight the safest option.

**Note!**
Stay focused on route comparison and selection, not the entire navigation app.

## Insights
**Officer Insights**
Law enforcement users need fast, actionable insights in high-pressure situations.

**Anonymous Reporting**
Citizens using the reporting app value ease of use and anonymity when reporting incidents.

**Safe Navigation**
Navigation users want clear, real-time safety indicators to trust the recommended route.

## Tips
